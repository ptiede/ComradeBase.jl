Uses Julia's Threads @threads macro when computing the intensitymap or visibilitymap.
You can choose from Julia's various schedulers by passing the scheduler as a parameter.
The default is :dynamic, but it isn't considered part of the stable API and may change
at any moment.

Threads the for-loop expression `expr` using the specified `executor`. The executor must be one of
